DB: H2 SQL CRUD based

I'd be happy to describe the miniature project you've created to showcase the architecture layers for a Java backend implementation using Spring Data JPA for CRUD operations and H2 SQL as the database, with REST API endpoints tested using Postman.

### Project Overview:

This miniature project is a demonstration of a microservice application built using Java with Spring Boot, showcasing the following architecture layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**:
   - This layer handles HTTP requests and responses.
   - It includes REST API endpoints implemented using Spring MVC.
   - Endpoints are responsible for processing incoming requests, executing business logic, and returning appropriate responses.

2. **Service Layer**:
   - The service layer encapsulates business logic.
   - It contains service classes that orchestrate interactions between controllers and repositories.
   - Service classes manage transactions, validations, and other business operations.

3. **Persistence Layer**:
   - This layer deals with data storage and retrieval.
   - Spring Data JPA is used for seamless interaction with the database.
   - Entities represent domain objects and are mapped to database tables.
   - Repositories provide CRUD operations for interacting with entities.

4. **Database**:
   - H2 SQL database is utilized for data storage.
   - H2 is an in-memory database, convenient for development and testing purposes.
   - It provides SQL support compatible with other relational databases.

5. **Testing**:
   - Postman is used to test the REST API endpoints.
   - Tests cover CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to ensure the functionality of the API.
   - Integration tests may also be implemented to validate interactions between layers.

### Technologies Used:

- **Java**: The primary programming language for backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: Provides a framework for building microservices with minimal configuration.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access using the JPA specification.
- **H2 SQL Database**: Lightweight and fast in-memory database.
- **Postman**: A popular API client for testing and debugging HTTP APIs.
