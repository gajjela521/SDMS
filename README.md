DB: H2 SQL CRUD based

I'd be happy to describe the miniature project you've created to showcase the architecture layers for a Java backend implementation using Spring Data JPA for CRUD operations and H2 SQL as the database, with REST API endpoints tested using Postman.

### Project Overview:

This miniature project is a demonstration of a microservice application built using Java with Spring Boot, showcasing the following architecture layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**:
   - This layer handles HTTP requests and responses.
   - It includes REST API endpoints implemented using Spring MVC.
   - Endpoints are responsible for processing incoming requests, executing business logic, and returning appropriate responses.

2. **Service Layer**:
   - The service layer encapsulates business logic.
   - It contains service classes that orchestrate interactions between controllers and repositories.
   - Service classes manage transactions, validations, and other business operations.

3. **Persistence Layer**:
   - This layer deals with data storage and retrieval.
   - Spring Data JPA is used for seamless interaction with the database.
   - Entities represent domain objects and are mapped to database tables.
   - Repositories provide CRUD operations for interacting with entities.

4. **Database**:
   - H2 SQL database is utilized for data storage.
   - H2 is an in-memory database, convenient for development and testing purposes.
   - It provides SQL support compatible with other relational databases.

5. **Testing**:
   - Postman is used to test the REST API endpoints.
   - Tests cover CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to ensure the functionality of the API.
   - Integration tests may also be implemented to validate interactions between layers.

### Technologies Used:

- **Java**: The primary programming language for backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: Provides a framework for building microservices with minimal configuration.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access using the JPA specification.
- **H2 SQL Database**: Lightweight and fast in-memory database.
- **Postman**: A popular API client for testing and debugging HTTP APIs.

### Implementation:

1. **Entity Classes**:
   - Define the structure of domain objects and their relationships.
   - Annotated with JPA annotations to specify mappings to database tables.

2. **Repository Interfaces**:
   - Extend Spring Data JPA's `JpaRepository` interface.
   - Provide methods for CRUD operations and other queries.

3. **Service Classes**:
   - Implement business logic and coordinate data access.
   - Inject repository interfaces for database interaction.
   - Handle transactions and business validations.

4. **Controller Classes**:
   - Define REST API endpoints.
   - Handle incoming HTTP requests, delegate processing to service classes, and return appropriate responses.

5. **Configuration**:
   - Configure Spring Boot application properties for database connection and other settings.
   - Set up dependencies and beans using annotations.

6. **Testing**:
   - Use Postman to send requests to API endpoints and verify responses.
   - Test each CRUD operation to ensure correctness and reliability.

### Conclusion:

This miniature project demonstrates a well-structured microservice application built with Java and Spring Boot. By leveraging Spring Data JPA, H2 SQL database, and Postman for testing, it showcases the seamless integration of various technologies to achieve a robust and scalable backend architecture. This project serves as a valuable showcase for understanding the implementation of RESTful APIs and the layered architecture in Java-based microservice development.
